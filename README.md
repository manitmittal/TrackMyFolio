# TrackMyFolio
## _Make Investments based on Research and not borrowed conviction!_

## Problem Statement
With the huge inflow of retail participants in the markets in the last few years has made Indian equity markets more stable than before and the dependence on FIIs has been reducing ever since, this leading to Indian Markets outperforming the much mature Markets like US in the periods whenever Institutional Investors mobilized funds out of equity markets. The increased retail participation has no doubt made Indian equity market more powerful, but with this power comes the responsibility to protect the interests of retail investors. Although regulatory bodies have been introducing many policies, but I believe the real protection of retail investors can be done only through education.
